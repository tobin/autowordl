# This is a solver for the game WORDLE [https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle].
# Instead of spoiling the "official" WORDLE, here is a clone of it that you can
# play as often as you want: http://foldr.moe/hello-wordl/ .
#
# Currently this is a very naive solver with a runtime of O(N^3) where N is the 
# number of words of the dictionary. For every possible answer and every possible
# guess, we count how many of the other possible answers would be eliminated by
# that guess.
#
# The dictionary on my system contains 4567 words, so this means that this program
# would require 95 billion iterations to compute the best first word. To make
# matters worse, the function that evalues a guess (called "score") is itself very
# slow. There are many opportunities for optimization.
#
# This program is meant to be used from within ipython. After starting ipython:
#
#     from autowordl import *
#     play_wordl(words)
#
# will have the computer play a game of Wordle against itself. Alternatively, you
# can instantiate the solver:
#
#     solver = WordlSolver(words)
#
# Suppose your initial guess was 'SLANT' and the result was 's.a..' (meaning that
# the 'S' and 'A' appear in the answer but the other letters do not; i.e. "S" and "A"
# are yellow and the other letters are grey). You can tell the solver about this result:
#
#     solver.apply_result("SLANT", "s.a..")    # --> 188 words still feasible:
#
# Now ask the solver to suggest the next best guess:
#
#     solver.think()
#
# The program suggests "CARES" as the next guess. The "C" is grey, but "ARES" light
# up in green! (Meaning the answer has no "C", but does end in "ARES".):
#
#     solver.apply_result("CARES", ".ARES")
#
# The solver replies with:
#
#     7 words still feasible:
#     ['BARES', 'DARES', 'FARES', 'HARES', 'MARES', 'PARES', 'WARES']
#
# When searching for possible answers, it is useful to search over all valid words,
# even if we know a valid word is not a possible answer. This is one such situation.
# Rather than guessing one of the 7 possible words remaining, we call solver.think()
# and it suggests.... 'APHID'.
#
# That's a pretty clever guess because 'APHID' will be able to tell us immediately
# whether the answer is PARES, HARES, or DARES. And if it is none of those, it still
# reduces the number of options from 7 to 4. We fall into that second, unlucky case:
#
#     solver.apply_result("APHID", "a....")
#
#     4 words still feasible:
#     ['BARES', 'FARES', 'MARES', 'WARES']
#
#     solver.think()
#     New best guess is WOMBS with 1.0
#
# Here we could try one of the four remaining feasible words for a change of 1/4
# of getting the answer, or we could try WOMBS, which will guarantee that we will
# know the answer on the next try.
#
# We try "WOMBS" and we get "..m.S". Because there's an M in the solution we know
# that the answer is "MARES":
#
#     solver.apply_result("WOMBS", "..m.S")
#     1 words still feasible:
#     ['MARES']
